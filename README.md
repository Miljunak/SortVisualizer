# SortVisualizer
SortVisualizer is a graphical program for visualizing sorting algorithms written in C++. It provides real-time, intuitive visualization of how different sorting algorithms work. The project leverages the SFML library for creating the graphical interface and animations.

## Features
The project incorporates a variety of sorting algorithms with customizable length and sort speed:
